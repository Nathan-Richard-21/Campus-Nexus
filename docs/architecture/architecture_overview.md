# System Architecture Overview  
## Architectural Style  
**Layered Architecture**  

## Alternatives Considered  
- **Microservices**: Overkill for current team size.  
- **Monolithic**: Limits future scalability.  

## Trade-offs  
✅ **Pros**: Modularity, easier testing, clear separation of concerns.  
⚠️ **Cons**: Slight latency between layers; requires strict interface design.  

## Risks & Mitigation  
- **Tight Coupling**: Enforce layer boundaries via interfaces.  
- **Performance**: Cache frequently accessed data.
